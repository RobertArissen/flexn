# Introduction

‚ö°Ô∏è Flexn SDK will help you create a **multiplatform app in no time**.

üíµ Building multiple projects to support different platforms is expensive and time-consuming. Instead,
**focus on your content** and just import components from Flexn SDK.

üì∫ Built-in focus control system allows for better **control** of your application behavior on the big
screen.

## Getting Started

Welcome to the Flexn SDK documentation!

If you're new to Flexn we recommend starting with [the learning course](tutorials/advanced/bootstrap).

The interactive course will guide you through everything you need to know to use Flexn SDK.

### System requirements

-   [Node.js 12.22.0](https://nodejs.org) or later
-   [Xcode](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode) on MacOS (not available for download on Windows or Linux) for running iOS and tvOS applications
-   [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) for Android applications

## Setup

To begin with, it's recommended to first install [ReNative](https://renative.org/):

<Tabs groupId="package-managers">
<TabItem value="yarn" label="Yarn" default>

```shell
yarn global add rnv
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="npm" label="NPM">

```shell
npm install rnv -g
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Before you get into building complex applications, we suggest starting with a template as it already prepares some things for you. Based on your skill, requirements, you can choose one of the three:

-   Flexn template (you can build it yourself following the tutorial)
-   Hello World template from ReNative - a simple application with some basic navigation structure
-   Blank template from ReNative (recommended for first-timers)

During `rnv new` you will be given an option to choose between these templates (or you could type the name of your custom one, but we will not do that this time around).

> For tutorial purposes starting off with the most basic - Blank template is recommended.

```shell
rnv new
```
